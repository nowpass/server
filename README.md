a [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) application



### Version info

This app was originally generated on Thu Dec 28 2017 19:41:25 GMT+0100 (CET) using Sails v1.0.0-45 _(internally: [`sails-generate@1.15.3`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.15.3/lib/core-generators/new))_.

This project's boilerplate is based on an expanded seed app provided by the [Sails core team](https://sailsjs.com/about) to make it easier for you to build on top of ready-made features like authentication, enrollment, email verification, and billing.
